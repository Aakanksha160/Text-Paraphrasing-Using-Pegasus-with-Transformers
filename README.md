# Text-Paraphrasing-Using-Pegasus-with-Transformers
This project uses Google's Pegasus model for text paraphrasing with the Hugging Face Transformers library in Python. It allows users to generate diverse, contextually accurate paraphrases, with adjustable parameters like beam search, output quantity, and randomness, offering flexibility in controlling the quality of paraphrased results.
